# PythonForEverybody

Goals (high level intended outcomes; for software, a Product Backlog)

Boundaries / Scope (where the functions and responsibilities of the solution start and end / what it should do and what is left to other systems to do)

Success criteria (set of conditions to be satisfied at completion; must be measurable and verifiable, like a test)

Constraints (externally imposed limitations on system requirements, design, or implementation or on the process used to develop or modify a system)

Assumptions (things that are accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof)

Stakeholders (individuals or organizations having a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or in its possession of characteristics that meet their needs and expectations)

Timelines (for software, a breakdown of high level goals like from the Product Backlog into time-bound smaller, more detailed tasks, like in Sprint Backlogs)

Goals
---------
Complete the Python for Everybody Specialization

Boundaries / Scope
-------------------
Complete Course 1 Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) 
Complete Course 2 Python Data Structures

Success criteria
-----------
My own application for data retrieval and processing.
Weekly work log with screenshots and summaries to demonstrate activity.

Constraints
-
I will be auditing the course for free so will be able to read and view the course content but not submit projects or earn the certification.

Assumptions
----
The courses will be available for the duration of the semester.
I have all required software.
I can skip the Installing and Using Python units.

Stakeholders
-
Professor - for grade

Parents - investing in my education and future success, want to make them proud

Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student portfolio which could help with getting a job

**Chapter 1: (2 hours)**

Started to go through the basic introductions of the course. Learned about the instuctor and some of the very basics of the course and why it was made. Ended after the "Why program?" section. Mostly this section was about why programming is important and why people should have some basic knowledge of the course.

Then he just went over installing python and getting it ready for use on your own computer. He went over on how to download it on the main platforms such as windows and mac.

He then briefly covers sequential steps and how computers simply go from one thing to the next thing. He then talks about conditional statements and how they lead to different answers.

Sequential steps - the computer goes line by line and runs every single line of code 

Conditional statements - if the certain criteria is true or false the computer will follow different paths of code depending upon user input (if statements)

Repeated steps - These statements run code multiple times until certain criteria is met, for example with loops they have iteration variables that change each time the code is ran and basically force the code to run only a certain amount of times (for and while loops)

**Chapter 2 : ( hours)**

Constants - value does not change, numeric values and strings are constants 

Reserved words - words that have some special function in python that you cannot use as variable names or identifiers
