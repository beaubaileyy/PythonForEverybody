# PythonForEverybody

Goals (high level intended outcomes; for software, a Product Backlog)

Boundaries / Scope (where the functions and responsibilities of the solution start and end / what it should do and what is left to other systems to do)

Success criteria (set of conditions to be satisfied at completion; must be measurable and verifiable, like a test)

Constraints (externally imposed limitations on system requirements, design, or implementation or on the process used to develop or modify a system)

Assumptions (things that are accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof)

Stakeholders (individuals or organizations having a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or in its possession of characteristics that meet their needs and expectations)

Timelines (for software, a breakdown of high level goals like from the Product Backlog into time-bound smaller, more detailed tasks, like in Sprint Backlogs)

Goals
---------
Complete the Python for Everybody Specialization

Boundaries / Scope
-------------------
Complete Course 1 Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) 
Complete Course 2 Python Data Structures

Success criteria
-----------
My own application for data retrieval and processing.
Weekly work log with screenshots and summaries to demonstrate activity.

Constraints
-
I will be auditing the course for free so will be able to read and view the course content but not submit projects or earn the certification.

Assumptions
----
The courses will be available for the duration of the semester.
I have all required software.
I can skip the Installing and Using Python units.

Stakeholders
-
Professor - for grade

Parents - investing in my education and future success, want to make them proud

Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student portfolio which could help with getting a job

**Chapter 1: (2 hours)**

Started to go through the basic introductions of the course. Learned about the instuctor and some of the very basics of the course and why it was made. Ended after the "Why program?" section. Mostly this section was about why programming is important and why people should have some basic knowledge of the course.

Then he just went over installing python and getting it ready for use on your own computer. He went over on how to download it on the main platforms such as windows and mac.

He then briefly covers sequential steps and how computers simply go from one thing to the next thing. He then talks about conditional statements and how they lead to different answers.

Sequential steps - the computer goes line by line and runs every single line of code 

Conditional statements - if the certain criteria is true or false the computer will follow different paths of code depending upon user input (if statements)

Repeated steps - These statements run code multiple times until certain criteria is met, for example with loops they have iteration variables that change each time the code is ran and basically force the code to run only a certain amount of times (for and while loops)

**Chapter 2 : (2 hours)**

Constants - value does not change, numeric values and strings are constants 

Reserved words - words that have some special function in python that you cannot use as variable names or identifiers

Variables - a name you choose to identify something with, is stored in the memory so a programmer can store data and then retrieve it later through the variable name. You can even change the contents assigned to the variable in a later statement.
  - must start with a letter or underscore 
  - must only consist of letters, numbers, and underscores 
  - are case sensitive 
A good variable name is something that is friendly to the user and easily identified 

Assignment statements - we assign a value to a variable using the assignment statement (=) an assignment statement consists of an expression on the right hand side and a variable to store the result

Operator precedence - When you string together operators in python it need to know what to do first, you indicate this through use of parenthesis

Operator precedence rules - highest to lowest: Parenthesis, power, multiplication (and division and remainder), addition (and subtraction), and left to right

Python knows the difference between integers and strings, however python cannot add an interger to a string.
You can use the type() function to distinguish whether something is an integer or string

Types of numbers:

Integers - whole numbers 
Floating point numbers - have decimal points
There are other number types that are variations of floats and integers 

Type conversions - when you put an integer and floating point number in an expression, the integer is implicitly converted to a float. You can control this with the functions float() and int()

Integer division - integer division produces a floating point result

String conversions - You can use float() and int() to convert between strings and integers, you will get an error if the string does not contain numeric characters 

User input - You can instruct python to pause and read data from the user using input() function, this function returns a string 

Comments in python - anything after a # is ignored in python
  - comments can help you describe what code is doing
  - document who wrote the code
  - turn off a line of code (maybe temporarily)

**Chapter 3: (3 hours)**

If statement:
  - reserved word that indicates you're going to be doing something conditionally
  - if the criteria is true then it executes the code, if it is false it moves onto the next condition and tests the same thing over again 
  - certain code may or may not run 
  - one way decision 

Comparison operators: 
 - Boolean expressions asks a question and produces a yes or no result which you can use to control program flow
 - Boolean expressions using comparison operators evaluate to true/ false or yes/ no
 - Comparison operators look at variables but do not change the variables
 
 **INDENTATION IN PYTHON IS VERY IMPORTANT**
 There can be a difference between tab and the proper amount of spaces for an indent, most text editors turn tabs into spaces
 Incorrect indentation can lead to errors in python 
 Using spaces (4) is reccomended over using tab
 
 Two-way decisions: 
 - Sometimes you want to do one thing if a logical expression is true and something else if the expression is false 
 - Like a fork in the road, must choose one path or the other, not both 
 
 Else statment:
 - within an if statement 
 - introduces another condition within the if statement
 
 Elif statement: 
 - Combination of else and if 
 - Can test multiple conditions
 - Once one of the conditions is met it skips the rest of the code and prints result
 - Runs until one of the conditions is met
 - Starts with if then followed by however many elif statements 
 - Can contain else at the end or you can leave else out 
 - If there is an else statement at the end then at least one condition will be met, if there is no else its possible to not meet any conditions 
 - Can have LOTS of elifs 
 
 Try/ except structure:
 - You surround a dangerous part of code with try and except
 - If the code in the try works, the except is skipped 
 - If the code in the try fails, it jumps to the except section 
 - Usually used to test for errors within code without python actually stopping your code
